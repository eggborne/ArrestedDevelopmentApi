## Further Exploration: Versioning 
_Versioning is the creation and management of multiple web API versions. How it is used here is to have a version 1 as a base minimum viable product, and have a version 2 as a working but work in progress version with additional code and comments_

## Technologies Used

* _C#_
* _.Net 6_
* _ASP.NET Core Web API_
* _Visual Studio Code 2019_
* _MySql_
* _MySql Workbench_
* _Entity Framework Core 6_
* _Pomelo Entity Framework Core 6 MySql_
* _ASP.NET Core Identity_
* _(Optional) Postman_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Install .Net 6 SDK:_
* [OS X and Windows Instructions](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-c-and-net)
* _Setup MySql Workbench:_
* [OS X and Windows Instructions](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql)
* _Clone this repo to a local directory_
* _Navigate to the local directory (YourPath/ArrestedDevelopmentApi.Solution/ArrestedDevelopmentApi) and create a new file "appsettings.json" 
* _Open this file with Visual Studio Code 2019 and add:
```
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[YOUR-DB-NAME];uid=[YOUR-USERNAME-HERE];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
  }
}

```
replace [YOUR-USERNAME-HERE] and [YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE] with the your own user and password values, and [YOUR-DB-NAME] with any name you'd like to call the database, i.e. "arrested_development_api"_

* _Using Terminal on OS X or PowerShell on Windows navigate to the directory that this repo was cloned to, then the ArrestedDevelopmentApi folder (YourPath/ArrestedDevelopmentApi.Solution/ArrestedDevelopmentApi) and run the terminal commands (without the '$'):_ 
* _$ dotnet ef database update_
* _Making sure you've followed the MySqlWorkbench installation instructions, open MySql Workbench and select the Local 3306 server_
* _Confirm the database [YOUR-DB-NAME] that you named was successfully created by clicking on the "Schemas" tab and seeing the schema listed._ 
* _Then run the program with command :_
* _$ dotnet watch run_
* _This will autolaunch Swagger in your browser_
* _Test any API endpoints in Swagger, POSTMAN, or your own app_

## API Endpoint Guide and Example
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/quotes/
```
* _Returns all quotes in the database_

Postman Example:  
Start a new GET request in Postman and enter the above URL. Click Send. You should see a JSON response with all quotes in the database.  

Example Return Response:
```
[
  {
    "quoteId": 2,
    "speaker": "Buster",
    "text": "What do you expect, Mother? I'm half machine!"
  },
  {
    "quoteId": 3,
    "speaker": "Buster",
    "text": "I'm a monster!"
  }
]
```

```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/quotes/{id}
```
* _Returns a quote with the matching quoteId_
* _Replace {id} with the quoteId you would like to GET_
* _Tip: You can find all quoteId's from requesting GET http://localhost:5000/api/quotes/ end point_

Postman Example:  
Start a new GET request in Postman and enter the above URL. Click Send. You should see a JSON response with the quote that matches the quoteId you entered.  
Example Return Response for quoteId equals 7:
```
{
    "quoteId": 7,
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "text": "You could charm the black off a telegram boy"
}
```
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/quotes/
```
* _Creates a new quote in the database_

Postman Example:  
Start a new POST request in Postman and enter the above URL. A POST request must have a request body when sending. 
To create a request body, click the Body tab located under where you entered the url, and select raw. In the dropdown menu to the right change Text to JSON.
Enter a JSON request body replacing "string" with the value you would like to enter.  
Example Request Body:
```
{
    "quoteId": 0,
    "speaker": "string",
    "text": "string"
}
```
Click Send. You should see a JSON response with the quote that you entered.

```
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/quotes/{id}
```
* _Updates a quote in the database_

Postman Example:  
Start a new PUT request in Postman and enter the above URL. A PUT request must have a request body when sending.
To create a request body, click the Body tab located under where you entered the url, and select raw. In the dropdown menu to the right change Text to JSON.
Enter a JSON request body replacing "string" with the values you would like to enter and 0 with the quoteId you would like to update. Note: You must enter an quoteId in the request body, and the entire body's values must still be assigned with either new or old values.  
Example Request Body:
```
{
  "quoteId": 0,
  "speaker": "string",
  "text": "string"
}
```
Click Send. You should see a JSON response with the quote that you updated.

```
DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/quotes/{id}
```
* _Deletes a quote in the database_

Postman Example:  
Start a new DELETE request in Postman and enter the above URL. Click Send. You should see a return status of 204 No Content.  
Confirm the quote was deleted by requesting GET http://localhost:5000/api/quotes/{id} and seeing a return status of 404 Not Found.
